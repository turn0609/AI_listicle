# GenAI first impressions

Since graduating high school 4 years ago,
my entire college experience has highlighted how GenAI has revolutionized the way people perform everyday tasks.
Realistically, I have been using AI for most of my academic life.

However, I have noticed that with the introduction of more powerful GenAI, that point is being lost.
In this listicle, I will discuss three ways in which GenAI encourages fast answers over creativity and building skills.

## Quick Text Generation

Quick text generation is arguably the biggest reason that GenAI, like Large Language Models (LLMs), is so popular.
In general, I have found that a lot of people dislike the writing process.
As a TWC major, even I can empathize with the monotony that comes with writing the same thing over and over again.
Things like emails and short academic summaries can be time-consuming and annoying to create.
