# GenAI first impressions

Since graduating high school 4 years ago,
my entire college experience has highlighted how GenAI has revolutionized the way people perform everyday tasks.
Realistically, I have been using AI for most of my academic life.
Programs like Grammarly and CitationMachine have helped me simplify tasks that would otherwise take me a longer time to do.
The key point I always highlight when advocating for AI uses like this is that
I already know how to proofread a paper and cite a source (I could do it by paper if asked).
However, I have noticed that with the introduction of more powerful GenAI, that point is being lost.
In this listicle, I will discuss three ways in which GenAI encourages fast answers over creativity and building skills.

## Quick Text Generation

Quick text generation is arguably the biggest reason that GenAI, like Large Language Models (LLMs), is so popular.
In general, I have found that a lot of people dislike the writing process.
As a TWC major, even I can empathize with the monotony that comes with writing the same thing over and over again.
Things like emails and short academic summaries can be time-consuming and annoying to create.
GenAI has made it possible for LLMs to write these things for you in a matter of seconds. 
In some cases, generating a lot of text quickly can seem like a lifesaver.
I still argue that for anything longer than a generic email,
You should be able to generate your own text in your own words.
The consistent generation of text for you degraded your overall quality of writing
and doesn't help you build effective communication skills.

## Loss of Human "Touch"

Even though GenAI is trained on human products, the use of GenAI takes the human out of what once was a human creation.
By stripping text to simply calculate the statistical probability that one word should come after another,
GenAI creates an often inaccurate amalgamation of human work.
For example, generating an email using GenAI takes the human-ness out of the email.
I, personally, am a lot less likely to respond to an email that sounds like it was written by a robot
than I am to an email written by a real person.
Further, if everyone starts using GenAI to churn out simple communications,
then will any of our communications even be human anymore?
At what point are we just spewing robot summaries back and forth and eliminating the humans in the interaction?
I deeply believe there are benefits in ensuring the presence of the "human touch".

## Brainstorming Is No Longer Brainstorming

Finally, I want to touch on one of the main things that students use GenAI for: brainstorming.
Oftentimes, people state that once they get past the brainstorming process,
they can easily write their own paper without further GenAI use.
Yes, brainstorming can be difficult and tedious.
But that is the point!
Brainstorming reinforces a person's ability to problem solve solutions that come from their prior knowledge and experience.
If GenAI does all of a student's brainstorming for them,
then that student is skipping the most critical aspect of a project.
If the brainstorming is no longer your own, it then becomes hard to defend claims or explain points that didn't originate from you.
Using GenAI for brainstorming creates a harmful cycle that simply encourages shortcuts being taken early in the project.

In general, it is beneficial for some things to be difficult.
That is how we learn and grow as people.
I find it extremely frustrating that many students (and people in general) are unwilling to face difficult situations,
Instead, turning to GenAI to create a solution for them.
While I understand that AI itself is very beneficial for society (I use AI in my everyday life as well),
GenAI should be prompting warning signs that people need to be able to think and perform actions by themselves.
